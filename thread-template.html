      <h1>Knock 'Em Dead</h1>
      <h4>Aker Rossen & Juliette Thierry</h4>
      <div class="d-flex flex-column row-hl">
    
        <div class="p-4 item-hl bg-light">
          <div><img src="images/avatar_AR.png" alt="Aker Rossen" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
          <div>
            <p>He tipped his head upward and allowed it to roll back and forth between his shoulders for a good stretch. A
              black cord trailed from each ear to a central point where the two cords combined into one and then disappeared
              into the deep pocket of his basketball shorts. Unlike others who might have worn shirts without the sleeves
              just to show off their arms, Aker wore a tank top for the simple fact it kept him cool during his workouts.
              Practical, not flashy.</p>
    
            <p>After rolling his shoulders to loosen the muscles, he took up his usual starting point with the gym
              equipment. Seated on one of the padded benches, he reached down and picked up the barbell in his right hand.
              With a glance at the mirror in front of him to check his posture, he began on his first set of curls.</p>
    
            <p class="font-italic">One...two...three…</p>
    
            <p>The space around him was mostly empty, which is what he had come to expect with his unusual schedule. Though
              the gym touted twenty-four seven service, even the staff at the front desk seemed to be falling asleep at the
              late hour of 11pm. It made it easier for him to get in his workout instead of waiting for other
              testosterone-laden men to give him a turn with the weighted plates.</p>
    
            <p class="font-italic">...five...six...seven…</p>
    
            <p>He made eye-contact with himself in the mirror and stared at the white strip of adhesive that held together
              the swollen skin of his lower lip. This was the trophy he'd scored the previous evening during one of the
              fights. The kid had scored another blow to his jaw that left it also tender, but there wasn't much to show for
              that one. That was before Aker had gained his second wind.</p>
    
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="p-4 item-hl">
          <div><img src="images/avatar_JT.png" alt="Juliette Thierry" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
          <div>
            <p>Juliette’s golden curls spilled around her face, escaping the elastic ponytail holder that pulled it up off
              the nape of her neck. It was just a few unruly wisps. The rest of her thick locks spilled down from the
              elastic and bounced merrily between her shoulders as she jogged. The treadmill wasn’t much of a workout for
              her but it had at least given her a healthy glow. Her pale cheeks were flushed pink and a thin coat of sweat
              glistened on her forehead. </p>
    
            <p>Sometimes it frustrated her that as a shifter she had to work even harder at working out to get any benefit.
              Her heart rate was only minutely increased after her hour of effort. The night sky filled the expansive plate
              glass window in front of her, reminding her that the day had come to an end. During the time that the rest of
              the world was winding down, Jewel was finally hitting her stride. </p>
    
            <p class="font-italic">Thump….thump….thump….</p>
    
            <p>She never altered her pace until he walked in. For just a split second she was distracted and broke her
              rhythm as her wide blue eyes watched him cross the room. Her steps slowed slightly then fell back into place
              as she blinked owlishly and refocused her attention. </p>
    
            <p>He was injured this time. Of course, it didn’t escape her notice. Juliette was keenly observant on many
              levels even without the aid of her feathered spirit guide. Concern immediately began to swell up inside of her
              but she swallowed it down and forced herself not to look as he gripped the weights and began his curls. </p>
    
            <p class="font-italic">Focus, Juliette! Focus!</p>
    
            <p>Silently she scolded herself as her hips swayed and accentuated her gait.</p>
    
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="p-4 item-hl bg-light">
          <div><img src="images/avatar_AR.png" alt="Aker Rossen" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
          <div>
            <p>He switched the barbell to the other hand and started the set on that arm. His attention flicked to the
              positioning of his body, but something else caught his eye. The blonde with the curvy hips and pretty face was
              stationed at the treadmill as she was nearly every night when he came in for his workout. He didn't know her
              name, but that didn't stop him from appreciating the way she looked.</p>
    
            <p>He smiled to himself and let his eyes refocus to his arm. It wouldn't be good to be labeled a pervert for
              watching other gym members. Instead, he'd settle for occasional glances her way when he could get away with
              it. Crap...had he lost count again? Served him right for not paying attention to his workout. </p>
    
            <p>Starting his count anew, he began to think back on the previous evening. After the kid had gotten his blows
              in, Aker had unleashed on him. A shot to the stomach had moved his opponents' attention down lower and opened
              the face for a quick jab to the left eye. Like a brick, the kid had lost his balance and dropped. It was too
              easy when this was all his life consisted of. Fighting and aggression to get results.</p>
    
            <p>A sharp pain traveled up his arm in complaint of too many curls. His immediate response was to purse his lips
              to silence the grunt of pain it warranted, but it didn't work the way he had thought. The adhesive released
              and his wound reopened. <b>"Shit!"</b> he snarled under his breath while immediately dropping the weight onto
              the rubber-padded floor. </p>
    
            <p>He hardly had to glance at the mirror to know what had happened and the odd sensation of something wet
              running down to his chin caused him to tilt his head upward to prevent the blood from dripping onto the bench.
              One hand moved under his chin to catch any droplets and he began to stand so he could find the nearest paper
              towel dispenser and stop the bleeding. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="p-4 item-hl">
          <div><img src="images/avatar_JT.png" alt="Juliette Thierry" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
          <div>
            <p>Her attention was fractured by his presence. Then again, Juliette Theirry was not known for her ability to
              concentrate. The moments she spent lost in a book were her most successful moments of concentration. Her mind
              was a fickle thing, often multitasking and fantasizing as if she lived in two realities at once – or perhaps
              more. The rugged stranger had become the most recent trigger of such fantasies. </p>
    
            <p>With the aid of the expanse of glass in front of her, those jeweled blue eyes lingered on his reflection.
              Silently she cataloged his biceps and his triceps as they flexed in a smooth repetitive motion. Jewel bit down
              on her lower lip softly and blushed as she found his gaze drifting over her curves before he returned to his
              reps. It was the first indication she had that he was even remotely interested.</p>
    
            <p>With a smirk spreading slowly across her lips she giggled softly to herself and increased the pace of her
              steps. The smooth glide of the treadmill beneath her feet distracted her from her meddling impulses. They sat
              there burning in the back of her throat every time her gaze flickered to the gash in his lip. It wasn’t the
              first time she had seen him injured and judging by what she had witnessed at the fight club, it wouldn’t be
              the last. It would do her no good to fuss over such an inconsequential scrape. </p>
    
            <p>That was he thought process that had convinced her to keep her concern to herself and continue with her
              workout instead of interrupting him. He had appeared to be a creature of habit thus far. Probably not
              accustomed to a fluttering, impulsive little blonde such as herself. </p>
    
            <p>Those thoughts were quickly disrupted as he pierced the silence with his coarse voice. Her eyes widened as
              blood cascaded down his chin and into his palm. Caught off guard she yelped sharply and went stumbling off of
              the treadmill. The moment she regained her balance, Juliette was by his side with a towel in her hand. Bright
              blue eyes blinked up at him as she cupped the towel under his hand and patted his shoulder gently. <b>“Here
                you are, darlin.’”</b> </p>
    
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="p-4 item-hl bg-light">
          <div><img src="images/avatar_AR.png" alt="Aker Rossen" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
          <div>
            <p>All thoughts had fled his mind and refocused on the pain of his throbbing lip and keeping his chin tilted up
              high enough to prevent blood from dripping. It was amazing how much pain could silence other senses, such as
              hearing and make him temporarily unaware of his surroundings.</p>
    
            <p>Warm liquid dripped onto his other hand while the other aimlessly pawed for a towel he hoped was nearby. That
              was when he felt the touch on his shoulder. Instinctively, he twisted his torso in the opposite direction with
              a jerk of his shoulder to free himself from the touch. <b>"Fuck off!"</b> he snarled as he took a step further
              in his unexpected direction. </p>
    
            <p>Another step squared him around to glare at who had the audacity to touch him. Already a fight was brewing
              within and just itching to be settled with violence. His dark eyes met dazzling blue ones and a blink later,
              he processed the face and placed her. The glare lessened and another heartbeat passed and then he yanked the
              earbuds from his ears with one hand. </p>
    
            <p>In her hand was a towel, which he could assume was only meant for him to mop himself up with. God help him,
              he felt guilty for having snapped at someone attempting to help him, but instead of an apology, the next words
              out of his mouth were defensive. <b>"I'm fine."</b></p>
    
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="p-4 item-hl">
            <div><img src="images/avatar_JT.png" alt="Juliette Thierry" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
            <div>
              <p>She was concerned by the gore that smeared across his face. Anyone would be. At least anyone who was capable of feeling sympathy for others. It wasn’t unusual for one to feel the tingling sensation of worry surging through their veins at the sight of an injury. It was her undeniable impulse to help that could possibly be considered odd by others – or perhaps meddlesome. Papa had always teased that she should be a nurse instead of a librarian to which Jewel replied that she had had enough of patching up stubborn men. Apparently, she had not been truthful in that statement for she found herself in that situation once again.</p>

              <p>Juliette was all too willing to rush to the aid of the coarse stranger. The receptionist raised her head and pulled her earbuds out of her ears just long enough to see that the fluttering little owl was on the case and shake her head with a chuckle. She seemed to be amused by the scene before her as the man snarled at the good Samaritan. The harsh words brought an unexpected smirk to the shapely blonde’s lips as she held back a giggle. With wide eyes she pulled her hand away from his shoulder and curled it into a tight little fist. It rested below her chin as her thumb jutted out and slipped between her lips. To contain her mirth, she nibbled her polished nail and shook her head. <b>“You are even more stubborn than you appear.”</b></p>

              <p>Head quirked to the side she observed him. Beneath her skin her pulse fluttered and her emotions were flooded with an unusual mixture of amusement, fear and homesickness. He was even more like the hellhounds she grew up with than she thought. The tension in his body, the defensive hunch of his shoulders, the power in his voice – he exuded a brawler’s mentality. Her frightened gaze fixed on his as he turned to face her down. With a shaky breath she steadied herself and huffed softly. If those hellhounds were here his throat would be clenched in their fist by now. Tsking at him she shook her head. <b>“You are stubborn and you are awful at deception. Perhaps you are fine, but I would prefer not to use a machine soaked in blood thank you very much.”</b> Jewel’s words were saturated with amusement as she shoved the towel towards him once again and gave one of her patented dreamy smiles with an expectant look. </p>
      
            </div>
          </div>
          
          
          <div class="p-4 item-hl bg-light">
              <div><img src="images/avatar_AR.png" alt="Aker Rossen" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
              <div>
                <p>He blinked at the stranger as he tried to comprehend her body language. Her thumb was trapped between her lips and he swore she was attempting to mask her...laughter? Was she laughing <i>at</i> him?</p>

                <p>Fear was what he had been expecting to be her response. He had a tendency to use his bark to intimidate and get his way. He saw her wide-eyed expression and recognized the display of wariness that usually accompanied it, but she didn't step back. In fact, he watched her summon courage and she tsked at him in a way he hadn't heard in years.</p>

                <p>Emotion remained off his features, but inside his brain, a storm was taking place. He prided himself on being able to read body language, but she had done the opposite of what he had expected. Instead of back off as he'd expected, she'd stood her ground in a way that reminded him of scrappy fighters who had entered the fighting ring with him. They might not have been intimidating, but they were always the ones who went down swinging the hardest.</p>

                <p>Stubborn was a trait that ran in his blood and truthfully, he hadn't intended for her to buy his statement as much as back away in surrender. His tactic should've worked, just as it had every other time he had employed it, but with this woman, it did not. She waltzed past the warning signs like they were merely suggestions and shoved the towel at him. He focused on it while debating his next move, then readjusted his gaze on those intense blues. He had two options: turn and walk away or accept the towel.</p>

                <p>Aker took the towel and wiped his chin before pressing the cotton to his lip. The move stung, but he resisted the urge to respond to it. He looked down at the ground to be certain he hadn't spilled blood there, but thankfully, it was only himself he had painted with his own blood. When his eyes returned to her face, he caught sight of the smile there. People like that, he didn't understand; as if they hadn't seen how ugly the world was or what it was capable of. Two people hadn't walked more different lives, he was sure.</p>

                <p>Instead of thanking her, he gave her a small nod before turning away and walking toward the men's locker room so he could properly take care of the split lip and duck out from the expectant look of the blonde. She probably thought he would want to talk about what had happened or maybe how it made him feel or some bullshit. That was not something he was about to participate in.</p>
        
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="p-4 item-hl">
                <div><img src="images/avatar_JT.png" alt="Juliette Thierry" class="rounded-circle float-lg-left mr-3"></div>
                <div>
                  <p>He intrigued her. She often fixated on the people she ran into on a regular basis and he was no exception. It had been basic carnal attraction that drew her to him initially, but it slowly became much more of a fascination. Logically she knew she should be frightened but perhaps her self-preservation instinct was lacking. Or maybe she sensed in him something more than the hostile façade he presented. Whatever the reason, the more he grumbled at her, the more she was curious about the man who kept to himself so stubbornly.</p>

                  <p>Like Papa often said, curiosity killed the cat. Luckily for Juliette she was no such thing. She was a clever little bird. Clever and stubborn. It showed in the gleam of her eyes as she gathered up her courage and lightly scolded him for his taciturn reaction to her assistance. Regardless of how tough he thought he was, that lip really should be tended to. Especially since she had watched for signs of advanced healing and found none.</p>

                  <p>A satisfied smile spread across her lips as he finally took the towel. Despite being a clever little bird, she looked very much like the cat who ate the canary – proudly pleased with the way her insistence worked out. <b>"There you go. Now that wasn’t so bad, was it?”</b> With an arch of one golden brow she returned his wordless nod. Even in the face of his silence she was satisfied that he had accepted her help. </p>

                  <p>The tip of her ponytail brushed her bare neck as she shook her head at his retreating back and crossed her arms over her chest. Jewel watched him retreat to the locker room, back into his privacy, back into solitude. Her head tilted owlishly as she watched him walk away before she finally blinked and expelled a quiet sigh. He really did remind her of the pack of men that helped raise her. It was a slightly bittersweet thought.</p>

                  <p>Under the amused watch of the receptionist, Jewel fluttered back over to the treadmill. She gave it a thoughtful look before switching to the stationary bike to finish her routine and forced her busy mind not to overanalyze every minute detail of the brief encounter. It was much better to simply be content and return to getting lost in the adrenaline that the gym had to offer. For now. She made no promises to keep to herself in the future. That would be a very un-Jewel promise to make.</p>
