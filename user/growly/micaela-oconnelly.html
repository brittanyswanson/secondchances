        <span class="font-weight-bold">History: </span>

        <p>Matthew O'Leary and Connie Lagherty were high-school sweethearts who married in their final year of high school. Shortly after their graduation, Micaela was born and so began their family. In order to support his wife and infant, Matthew joined one of the local fishing crews.  This provided the growing family with a an income, although there were occasionally large gaps between paychecks, but they made it work.</p>

        <p>Eventually, it became necessary for Connie contribute to the family income by taking odd jobs.  This of course, was only possible once Micaela was old enough that Connie trusted her to watch after her siblings.  Eleven.  Young enough to not know better but old enough to possibly hold the fort down, Micaela was often left in charge of the three younger kids.  Trouble followed closely on the heels of the four, but most of their trouble was innocent and harmless.  There were certain expetations that came with a growing household.  It became easier once Tommy and Katie were old enough to help keep an eye on their siblings.  It forced a bond between them that would have possibly never formed otherwise, but also forced responsibility on the eldest a little too early.</p>

        <p>When Connie began to bring baked goods to the local farmer's market, Micaela begged to go with her mother and help.  With Tommy and Katie able to fulfill babysitting duties, her mother finally allowed her to accompany her to the market to help her. It gave her the opportunity to meet several diverse people and learn that she did enjoy the socialization aspect of the customer exchange.  Her mother would often catch her engaged in conversation with customers, but there was little harm, especially under the watchful eye of her.</p>

        <p>By the time she had graduated high school, she had realized while her classmates pursued university, her own options were limited.  Neither her mother or father had attended university and they had plotted out a successful, fulfilling life for their family, meaning she could too.  Besides the basic skills primary school had taught her, the only other strong skillset she could provide to an employer was her smile and social personality.  These skills drove her to accept a position at the local pub as a waitress.</p>

        <p>The job was often repetitive, but she thrived at befriending most who sat in her section.  Just as she had at the farmer's market as a teenager, she had no trouble starting a conversation with anyone and keeping them actively engaged.  Fueled by discussions with customers, Micaela began to soak information in.  Each accent she heard prompted her curiosity around where they hailed from and what those foreign lands held.  Her dreams of traveling the world would simply have to be through the stories her customers told.</p>

        <p>Back home, her siblings were the anchor which kept her from straying far from home.  There were times she felt frustrated by feeling tied down by them and yet she adored them all in the motherly fashion that an older sister does. Messing with one of the family would bring a whirlwind of a storm down on the aggressor as it seemed to empower the O'Leary clan to stick together as a unit and fight their battles as a unit. All of this held true until Tommy became secretive and distant from his siblings. Instead of telling his sister everything as they had always done as children, there was something that he held back from her. Micaela did her best to figure out what he was getting himself involved in and went so far as to follow him once or twice, but each time resulted in his anger and a greater distance being wedged between them. </p>

        <p>Despite having eased up on her investigation of her brother, she lost him. It wasn't until several days after he stopped coming home that the authorities were called to file the official missing person report. She could tell her younger siblings, including herself, all expected him to walk back into their lives the next day as though nothing was wrong, but it never happened. Tommy O'Leary was simply gone, likely a victim of whatever dangerous game he had been playing. </p>

        <p>The entire experience had been taxing on the whole family, but one good thing had come from it.  The investigation introduced her to her future husband, Detective Andrew O'Connelly.  Not only was he handsome and stoic, but he also encouraged her to find what she was passionate about and follow her dreams.  He wanted her to put herself first for once, instead of her family, which was just the permission she needed.  She began work for a travel agency, which allowed her to plan trips and put her knowledge of travel to good use.  Most were places she could only dream about going to, but it was a step in the right direction.</p>

        <p>By twenty-six, she was engaged to Andy. Where she was often full of sarcasm, mischief, and humor, he was serious and fond of order.  Where she enjoyed surrounding herself with others and fed off that energy, he preferred a quiet evening alone to recharge. Despite the personal differences, he was good for her in the fact he pushed her to be more independent from her family and to put herself first.  For once, she was able to find the backbone to tell her family 'no' instead of complying with every demand she would have otherwise done out of expectation.  He gave her strength.</p>

        <p>They married a short time later and settled into the mechanical rhythms of married life. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, go to sleep.  Wash, rinse, repeat. Determined to breathe life back into their relationship and to inject something fun into their lives, she planned and organized a hiking trip in the mountains. Early on in the trip, an accident resulted in the bite of a good samaritan to spare her life, which would forever be changed by the red fur of the fox.</p>
