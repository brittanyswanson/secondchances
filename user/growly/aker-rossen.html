        <span class="font-weight-bold">History: </span>

        <p>For as long as Aker could remember, it had always been his dad and brother. "Family's always got your back," Max frequently would say when he felt there was an appropriate moment for it. Always. Like most curious children, he wondered about the rest of the family. What about their mom? Will, his brother, had eight years on the youngest and could recall memories of time spent with her, but neither he nor Max liked to talk about her much and it always seemed like something more interesting came up when he was asking about it.</p>
      
        <p>Max was a hard-working father who owned the town's small hardware shop. He had one or two other employees who helped staff the counter or helped him with stocking or filling in here and there, but nobody nearly as dedicated to running the business as he was. Evenings were often spent in the closed store while he poured over finances and order forms in order to keep the business caught up. Meanwhile, both boys kept themselves busy with games between the aisles of hand tools and building supplies. Life was okay and family was everything.</p>
      
        <p>Schooling was never something that Aker excelled with. Like many of his peers, he was full of energy and life, but unlike many of them, he struggled with understanding written words. The problem continued to plague him through his first grade year and much to Max's disappointment, the younger boy was held back a year to practice on the much-needed skill. Will tried to teach his brother, but most of those lessons devolved into the boys playing with Will's video games instead. Instead of repeating the first grade a third year, Max shamefully pulled his youngest from school, insisting that he could teach him better. Although he had the best intentions, Max had too many other things keeping his attention at the store rather than helping Aker learn. Instead of a formal education, he helped his father around the shop.</p>
      
        <p>At twelve, a robbery at the hardware store turned the boys loose. As their father would have wanted, Will, now twenty, took ownership of the house and most importantly, took care of his brother. School was no longer an appealing or easy option for Aker, but neither was the hardware store, which left him to following Will around as he did odd jobs here and there to make ends meet. Those jobs weren't particularly legal, but Aker didn't mind as long as he was included and Will was happy to have the help with he and his so-called business partners. Jobs evolved over the years from petty burglary to carjacking, then eventually to intimidating targets. Finally, at the age of twenty-eight, Aker Rossen had taken his first life at the encouragement of his brother.</p>
      
        <p>Family's always got your back.</p>
