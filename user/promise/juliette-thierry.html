        <span class="font-weight-bold">History: </span>

        <p>Hazel Juliette Thierry is the unexpected but adored result of a workplace romance between two highly regarded professors at a Dartmouth College not terribly far away from Lux Falls. Life began there in New Hampshire but home changed many times as her parents changed jobs and pursued different goals. Juliette is the oldest daughter of Anastasia Hollinger and the second youngest daughter of Markus Thierry. Even though her parents were never formally married, Jewel has never lacked for family. In fact at times she felt incredibly overwhelmed by just how much family she had. The charismatic timber wolf came with two grown children and an older niece he was raising. Add that to aunts, uncles and grandparents from one side or the other and you have a free-spirited little girl feeling very much like she had way too many parents telling her what to do.</p>
      
        <p>Instead of being jealous when Greta came along, Jewel was incredibly relieved to no longer be the baby of the blended shifter family. The birth of Greta also gave her a little glimmer of hope that just maybe the romance would be more than temporary. A difference of opinion over the value of a formal marriage and contrasting visions of the future are what drove the two lovers apart, eventually agreeing to co-parent but not cohabitate. In the long run the girls had to accept the fact that their mother’s independent spirit would never be satisfied with a traditional relationship and respect the way their father understood that. As sad as that may sound, they didn’t really suffer at the hands of the unusual family dynamics.</p>
      
        <p>As you learn more about this little love child, it is really no surprise that the quixotic librarian grew up surrounded by books and musty old artifacts. The academic pursuits of both parents had a huge impact on Jewel’s childhood. Her father - an author and professor of French Literature - surrounded the girls with books. New books, old books, half-written books that Jewel tried to steal a peek at - they filled just about every corner of their home and kept her face hidden the majority of the time. She was often snatching whatever book he laid down so that she could read it and bug him with a million questions at a later time. Jewel loved literature so much that the professor often brought her to his summer classes with him before she even hit the teen years which amused his students. </p>
      
        <p>Juliette fell in love with the university library and thought of it as her second home, but home was a very flexible word when she was with Anastasia. Much like her falcon spirit, Ana was wild at heart. Her mother - now a museum curator, formerly professor of Egyptology - was constantly dragging her little girls off to exotic locations to find musty old parchments and cracked pottery. She nurtured their free spirit and filled their heads with myths and history from around the world. On these adventures Jewel stayed covered in dirt or dust and made quick friends with the local children, especially other shifters. Back in the states she was often wandering around the university or a museum fantasizing about living in the past.</p>
      
        <p>These are the most interesting bits of her history. The rest is pretty standard. Juliette was a good student who rarely got in trouble with her teachers - except for when she asked too many questions or corrected them or suggested a new vocabulary word. Oh, and then there was the time when she got in trouble for staging a protest over banned books being removed from her high school library. Oh! And the time she and Greta liberated the frogs from the biology lab.... and the time she purposefully defied the rule against holding hands at school because she felt it stunted the formation of healthy relationships. Well, and there was also the time she got sent out of sex ed class for bringing a copy of the Kama Sutra and insisting it was the most logical text book for the subject.</p>

        <p>So, in retrospect - maybe her quirky personality and her curiosity did get her in trouble quite a bit. This is why she feels so at home in libraries and museums - they encourage her curiosity instead of shaming her for it. When it came down to time for those grown up career path decisions, Jewel naturally followed her love of literature and research into the field of library sciences. It was a position as Circulation Manager at the local library that brought the wandering spirit to Lux Falls where she fell in love with the town's fascinating history and decided to stay. For Juliette life in Lux is all about finding a place that she can call home and recovering from a torrid romance with a woman who turned out to be a con-artist. Despite the heartache, Jewel still believes that it’s all just a part of the adventure and can't wait to see what the next chapter will bring.</p>
